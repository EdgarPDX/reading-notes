For your assignment, go through these resources, and create a new page/entry in your readings repository or Wiki that summarizes the principle topic as though you were presenting the material to a 301 level student.


Being a great developer is not something that you inherit overnight. In all the readings they state different approaches to becoming a great developer. However different these approaches are, together they give you the recipe to becoming great. From TDD to refactoring, the ongoing theme is to be proactive so that when creating products that are easy to work with regardless of who is coding. One example that really stuck with me was about the company that came out with a product that was rushed to market. Even though it was a great product it eventually was the demise of the company. It makes total sense though, how can you continue to update code that is sloppy and just causes more issues. I can't imagine having to be a developer and trying to look at someone else's code and thinking WTF WTF, WHERE DO I START?
