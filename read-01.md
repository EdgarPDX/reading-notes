MDN (only read up to (but not including) "Nesting Templates") (Links to an external site.)
    - Have been using template literals already. But good review
Google Developer (don't need to read "Tagged Templates") (Links to an external site.)
     - DSL: Domain Specific Language
      - This brings better String Interpolation
      - Embedded expressions
      - Multiline strings without hacks
      - string formatting
      - string tagging for safe HTML escaping, localization
            - String substitution: ${} use this syntax to use variables in strings
                - can add functions inside expressions ${FUNCTION()}
                - multiline expressions
                    "Yo\
                    World";

Array Methods

MDN forEach (Links to an external site.)
     - Provides a call back for each element inside the array in acsending order.
     - callback isinvoked with three arugments
            - the value of the element 
            - the index of the element
            - the array object being traversed
    - forEach() does not mutate array
for vs forEach (No need to read past first two paragraphs of "When to use..." section)
 - forEach only works on arrays
