From the Duckett HTML book:

Chapter 2: “Text” (pp.40-61)
    -HTML elements are used to describe information being written. ie headings paragraph. 
    - Also, they can be used to add emphasis or change test.

Chapter 10: Ch.10 “Introducing CSS” (pp.226-245)
    -We have gone over a lot of what this chapter covers. I didnt know that you could use id as a selector. need to look into this more but seems specifying class will still be better. 
From the Duckett JS book:

Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.53-84)
    -multiline comments start with /*"commentHere" */
    -// single line comments, make sure you add comments
    -const is used instead of var but the idea is still there.
    
Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” only up to the section on switch statements (pp.145-162)
    - conditions are created to decide what should happen next. 
    - Evaluation of a condition returns either true or false
    - if/then/else - conditional statements
    --operators are below--
    == is equal to
    != is not equal to
    === strict equal to
    > greater than
    < less than
    >= greater than or equal to
    <= less than or equal to
    (score >= pass)
    score & pass are Operands

    ((score1 + score2) > (highScore1 + highScore2))
             ^operand                ^operand

    Logical operators
    
    && logical AND  ((2 < 5) && (2 >= 3)) this should return true since both are true

    || logical OR would return true if either one of the expressions were true

    ! Logical NOT takes single boolean value and inverts it. !(2 < 1) = true
