Promise 
    - Is a value that is not known right away. Meaning it has dependencies and will either have a value (parameter: fufilled or rejected ). reminds me of the "try" since if it did say what it was going to do it would work and give a value, if it did not go through then it would give you the catch.

Destructuring
    - Seems like this is giving indexes actual values. For example, array[0] is the first value of the array however if you have to arrays and make them equal to eachother [a, b, c] = [1, 2, 3] then a becomes the index of the other array to an extent. 
Spread
    - A way to inject values of an array into arguments or other arrays
Rest
    - Place holder for arguments in a function.
