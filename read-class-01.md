Promise 
    - Is a value that is not known right away. Meaning it has dependencies and will either have a value (parameter: fufilled or rejected ). reminds me of the "try" since if it did say what it was going to do it would work and give a value, if it did not go through then it would give you the catch.

Destructuring
    - Seems like this is giving indexes actual values. For example, array[0] is the first value of the array however if you have to arrays and make them equal to eachother [a, b, c] = [1, 2, 3] then a becomes the index of the other array to an extent. 
Spread
    - A way to inject values of an array into arguments or other arrays
Rest
    - Place holder for parameters in a function. Seems like it would be in the case that you wouldn't know how many parameters could be inputted? might need a better explanation on this.

TDD, Where Did It All Go Wrong
    - Write tests for requirements not implementation details. 
     - red green refactor
        - red write code that fails
        - green make test that work quickly
        - refactor remove duplication
    - test behaviors not implementation details. refactoring should not change the test.
what the heck is the event loop anyway
    - event loops is the process of calling the code in the task queue after the stack is complete. very complicated stuff here..
