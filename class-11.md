Reading
Here are the chapters to read/skim before class:

From the Duckett HTML book:

HTML/CSS book, Ch. 15, “Layout” (again; repeat of Class 4 reading)

Block Level Elements:
    - h1, p, ul, li
Inline Elements: flow in between surrounding text
    - img, b, i.
Containing Elements: 
    - if one block sits inside another block element then the outer block is the containing or parent element.
Controlling the position of elements: CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow a layout of a page
    - Normal Flow: Every block element apears on a new line vertically
    - Relative positioning: elements moved to right or left of where they would be if it was normal flow. Elements still cascade down as normal flow 
    - Absolute Positioning: Relative to it containing element. 
    - Fixed position: positions the element in relation to the browser window.
    - Floating elements: allow you to take the normal element out of normal flow and position it far left or right, element becomes block level element to which other elements can flow
Page sizes:
    - Web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide
    - fixed width layouts: these layouts dont change size as browser window increases or decreases.
    - liquid layouts:usually done in percentages, layout sizes increase and decrease relative to the size of the browser window.
Layout Grids:
    -
