Why you should use bcrypt
Understanding bcrypt
    - The bcrypt hashing function allows us to build a password security platform that scales with computation power and always hashes every password with a salt.
    - bcrypt allows building a password security platform that can evolve alongside hardware technology to guard against the threats that the future may bring, such as attackers having the computing power to crack passwords twice as fast.
    - encrypted 64 times
Where to store JWT
    - Securing SPAs that make API calls come with their own set of concerns. You'll need to ensure that tokens and other sensitive data are not vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) and can't be read by malicious JavaScript.
